## Abstract

UDomestication – the artificial selection of wild species to obtain variants with traits of human interest– was integral to the rise of civilization. During the neolithic, the oversupply of food enabled by the domestication of crop plants and farm animals was associated with the invention of food preservation strategies by microbial fermentation. However, apart from a few charismatic examples (e.g. yeasts used in mantou or wine), it remains unclear whether, as for plants and animals, fermented food microbes have also been domesticated by humans, and if so when and how did this happen.
Here, we propose to test if cheese starter cultures harbour typical hallmarks of domestication by phenotypically and genetically characterising over 100 community samples and >100 individual strains isolated from historical and modern traditional Swiss cheese starter cultures. We find that cheese starter cultures have low genetic diversity both at the species and strain-level and are taxonomically and phenotypically stable. Moreover, our analyses suggest that the evolutionary origin of cheese starter bacteria coincided with the start of cheesemaking as reported from archeological records, that these bacteria show signs of ongoing genome decay and pseudogenization via transposon insertion, and suboptimal performance in natural settings.
Taken collectively, these hallmarks suggest that cheese starter cultures have been unintentionally domesticated by humans, potentially starting as early as the neolithic. This domestication history in cheese starter culture contrasts with other microbes found in  other types of fermented food for which signs of domestication are currently lacking. We suggest that this discrepancy partly arose because cheese making practices employs “backslopping” to propagate microbes and provide highly stable and controled environmental conditions for the microbes. Future work documenting the prevalence of these hallmarks across diverse  fermented food systems and regions of the globe will be key to unveil the joint history of humanity with fermented food microbes.

## Script overview

The scripts are divided into three subscripts. Each on is saved and compiled as a Rmarkdown with extensive comments. The three parts consist of:

1. the general analysis including all genomic and non-genomic data-analysis
2. the plotting and analysis for the main body figures
3. the plotting and analysis for the supplemental figures

## Data availability

All data is stored on zenodo under the following doi:

xx

The genomic data is further stored under the following Bioprojects:

- PRJNA717134
- PRJNA717134
- PRJNA1048529


## Disclaimer

The analysis pipeline presented here should be complete however it has not been created as a standalone script. The purpose of the paper was not to generate a tool. Many dependencies are expected.
